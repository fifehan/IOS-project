# IOS-project
My personal project is a game that is meant to display my advancement and knowledge of Swift.
I chose to create a fun IOS game that measures the speed of peoples thumbs.
Two people will tap a button that counts up to a 100, who ever gets to a 100 first wins, and an alert will pop up showing who won.
I intend to keep adding things to the program like a timer mode or even a game mode that allows you to play with more than one iphone.
